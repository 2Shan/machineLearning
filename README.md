Definition of Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell

"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

- Supervised Learning = teach the computer how to learn
    + "right answers" are given 
	+ classification probelem = predict discrete valued output
	+ regression = predict continuous valued output 
	+ support vector machine allows an infinite number of features to be given as the "right answer"

- Unsupervised Learning = let the computer learn by itself
- Reinforcement Learning
- Recommender Systems
