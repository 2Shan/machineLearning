Logistic Regression
===================

Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm used for Classifiction Problems

- Binary Classification = output y is a discrete value of 0 (negative class) or 1 (positive class)
  + 0 <= Logistic Regression output(h_theta(x)) <= 1
  + h_theta(x) = g(theta^T * x) where ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?g%28z%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%20&plus;%20e%5E%7B-z%7D%7D)


- Multi-class Classification = output y can take on multiple values
