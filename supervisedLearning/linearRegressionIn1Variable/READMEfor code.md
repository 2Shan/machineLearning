Predicting City Population Using Linear Regression
==================================================

What each file or folder is for:

+ ex1.m = the main program 
+ TODO: label all other files

Build(How To Use This Code)
===========================
1. install Octave or Matlab

2. fork this repo and type ```git clone <HTTP link here>```
in your command line

3. navigate to the folder with the above files

4. type ```ex1``` 

5. You will see a printout of linear regression being applied to predict population size of new cities. Additionally there will be several graphs:
   + Graph of data 
   + Graph of cost function
   + Graph of minimal theta values for hypothesis equation
